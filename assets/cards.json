    "longDescription": "Kumano Kodo (熊野古道, Kumano Kodō) refers to a network of pilgrimage trails through the southern Kansai region. The Kodo (old ways) are a key part of the region's World Heritage designation and have been in use for over 1000 years. They are the only pilgrimage routes besides the Camino de Santiago to be designated a World Heritage site.\n \n  The pilgrimage routes developed as a way for people to move between the sacred areas on the Kii Peninsula. At the center of this religious area are the three Kumano shrines: Hongu Taisha, Hayatama Taisha and Nachi Taisha, collectively known as Kumano Sanzan. By the 12th century, the Kumano Sanzan were well known shrines in Japan, drawing pilgrims from Kyoto, Osaka and beyond.\n \n  More than just a means to reach the three shrines, the pilgrimage trails were designed to be a religious experience in themselves and often pass through difficult, even dangerous, mountain terrain. In addition to linking the shrines to one another, the Kodo pilgrimage trails link the Kumano area to Kyoto, Koyasan (the headquarter of Shingon Buddhism), Yoshino and Omine (centers of mountain worship) and Ise (Japan's most important shrine)."

    "description": "The Akame 48 Waterfalls offer a unique mix of ninja excitement, mysterious trails, the waterfalls themselves and enormous amphibians. A recreational path of about 4 km long.",
    "longDescription": "The Akame 48 Waterfalls are just over the border of east Nara into Mie Prefecture. With five main waterfalls, and numerous small overflows, they are a unique natural phenomenon of exquisite beauty.\n \n To add to the appeal there are also giant Salamanders and a tradition of ninja training. Akame valley was long ago established as a Buddhist Shugendo center and the name likely refers to the 48 vows of Amida Buddha. \n \nThe ninja connection is due to its location to the south of Iga-Kambe and Iga-Ueno, the heart of Mie ninja territory. If you’re a nature lover, or you just want to get your ninja on, Akame 48 Waterfalls are recommended. \n \nThe hike is about 4 km and most of it is pretty even keel. A few sections require you to climb some steps (sometimes slippery) to get up successive plateaus. It can take around 3 hours to complete the hike both ways. The magical scenery of glinting streams, emerald boulders, and valley-like majesty is momentum enough to propel you along."

    "longDescription": "Meoto Iwa (夫婦岩, the Wedded Rocks) are two sacred rocks in the ocean near Futami, a small town in Ise City. The larger of the two rocks represents the husband and the smaller one represents the wife.\nBoth rocks are connected by a shimenawa rope which acts as the division between the spiritual and earthly realms. In a ceremony, the shimenawa rope is replaced three times a year. Visitors are advised to visit the Meoto Iwa during high tide when the rocks are actually separated by water.\n \n More difficult to catch is the famous view of the sun rising between the two rocks on a fine summer morning. If you are in favor with the gods, you get both the sun rising between the rocks at high tide plus the silhouette of Mt.Fuji in the distance. Visibility needs to be extraordinarily good in order for the iconic mountain to be visible. \n \nNot far from the Meoto Iwa is the Futami-Okitama Shrine, where a number of shinto deities (kami) are enshrined. Many frog sculptures can be seen in the vicinity of the shrine as they are believed to be a type of charm for bringing people or things back. The path that leads to the rocks carries on eastwards, passing another small shrine, the Ryugu Shrine which is dedicated to the dragon god of the seas. "

    "longDescription": "Nabano no Sato has one of Japan's finest and most famed winter illuminations with over 5.8 million LEDs, lighting up the darkness of a chilly winter night, creating romantic images of mountains, oceans, flowers, shapes and figures among immense flower gardens, along with open-air hot spring foot baths and spas, fine restaurants and shops. \n \nA family-oriented theme park abundant in facilities and beauty located in Kuwana City, next to Nagoya. The dazzling display happens every winter! Regular illuminated attractions include the walk-through Tunnel of Light, very popular with romantically linked couples, the Cloud of Lights, and every year one, of the major flower garden areas is transferred into a fairyland-like dazzling display. Previous themes include Nature, Waterfalls, Aurora and Flowers. Winter visitors will want to rug up well, as Nagashima can become very cold, with the occasional snowfall not out of the ordinary.\n \n In fact, snowfall could well be a welcome bonus, as the light-reflecting speckles of snow would accentuate the beauty of the park. On a chilly winter’s night, it won’t be the cold that gives you goosebumps, but the amazing illuminated spectacle before you. With the flick of a switch, the night becomes an oasis of light."

The water park is densely packed with water slides and swimming pools, including a wave pool, but is open only in the summer.

Also available are jacuzzis, saunas, massage services and restaurants."
